                    Only a few months, I was amazed by the products I was making, and see the great potential that I had never seen and imagined before.
                    At 2021, I chose to go back to university to further my studies.Now I am confidence to be able to bring AI into industrial results and open a new chapter for the future!

                    Focus on industry applications that need highly customization and can't use generic AI models.
                    For example, product quality inspection, term understanding processing in specialized fields,
                    through computer vision or natural language processing, using currently available pre-trained models can
                    maximize efficiency and provide a range of systems in addition to the models themselves,
                    such as data pre-processing and servitization.
